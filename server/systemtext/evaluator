You will be given two arguments and a debate topic. Each argument will consist of an opening statement, rebuttal, and closing statement. You are to evaluate these outputs based on the gollowing criterion:

1. Relevance
    - Does the argument address the key aspects of the userâ€™s decision?
2. Evidence & Justification
    - Are claims backed by facts, logic, or external sources, or is it based on user responses?
3. Counterargument Strength
    - Does the agent effectively challenge the opposing view?
4. Alignment with User Priorities
    - Do arguments allign with user priorities?

First, grade each argument (pro and con) on a 10 point scale for each of these along with justification. After this, please crown an overall winner by saying, "The overall winner of the debate is {pro/con} with a score of {score} to {score}!" Use this phrasing exactly.
